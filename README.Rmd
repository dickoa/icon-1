An R package to easily insert web icons into R documents. Many icons are available for use around the web, which provides new options (or fun) for digital expressions.


# Installation

The **development** version can be installed from GitHub using:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mitchelloharawild/icon")
```

# Usage

Icons can be inserted inline using inline code `` `r '\x60r icon::fa("rocket")\x60'` ``. Otherwise, chunks can also be used.

````
```{r, eval=FALSE}
icon::fa("rocket") # equivalent to icon::fa$rocket()
```
````

Custom icon sets can be created using the `icon_set()` function, which accepts a directory of SVG files and allows them to be used as icons.

````
```{r, eval=FALSE}
icon::icon_set("my_icon_folder")
```
````

# A Note on the old API

This is the second iteration of the icon package, the [first icon package](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/icon) has been successful, but lacked a few features such as SVG icons, user defined libraries, and extensibility support. You can read the notes on the new API [here](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/icon/issues/19). It turns out that it was easier to build the new and improved icon from scratch, which is what this repository is. In the future this version of icon might just be merged into rOpenScilabs/icon, but for the mean time it will be developed here. We anticipate that there will only be any minor changes to the existing API, so hopefully this will be a seamless transition for users! Notably, the `icon_name` functions have been removed in favour of `icon$name`, and the interface for styling and animating has been removed/changed.
